Overview of Sockets
A socket is a software endpoint used to send and receive data over a network. Sockets enable communication between two machines over protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol). They are essential for network programming, allowing processes to connect, send data, and receive data, typically using a combination of an IP address and a port number.

There are two main types of sockets:

TCP Sockets (Stream Sockets) - These provide reliable, connection-oriented communication. They ensure that data is received in the correct order without loss.
UDP Sockets (Datagram Sockets) - These provide a connectionless communication model with no guarantees of delivery, making them faster but less reliable.
Common Socket States (TCP)
When using TCP, a socket goes through several states as it establishes, maintains, and terminates a connection. Understanding these states can help diagnose network issues and optimize performance. Here are some of the most common TCP socket states:

1. LISTEN
The socket is waiting for incoming connection requests. This is typically seen on the server side, where it is passively listening for client connections.

2. SYN-SENT
The socket is actively trying to establish a connection. This state occurs when a client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to initiate a connection.

3. SYN-RECEIVED
The socket is waiting for the client's acknowledgment after sending its own SYN-ACK packet. This state usually appears on the server side during the TCP three-way handshake.

4. ESTABLISHED
The connection is fully established, and both sides can send and receive data. This is the normal state for an open connection where communication is taking place.

5. FIN-WAIT-1
The socket is closing its side of the connection and has sent a FIN (finish) packet. It is waiting for an acknowledgment from the other side.

6. FIN-WAIT-2
The socket has sent its FIN packet and received an acknowledgment. Now it is waiting for the other side to close the connection.

7. CLOSE-WAIT
The socket has received a FIN packet from the other side, indicating that the other side wants to close the connection. It is waiting for the application to acknowledge this and close the socket.

8. CLOSING
Both sides have sent FIN packets, but not all have been acknowledged yet. This state is rare and usually happens when both sides close simultaneously.

9. LAST-ACK
The socket is in the process of closing after sending its FIN packet and is waiting for the final acknowledgment from the other side.

10. TIME-WAIT
The socket is waiting for a period of time (usually twice the maximum segment lifetime, or 2 * MSL) to ensure that any delayed packets have been properly handled before closing completely. This is a safety measure to prevent conflicts with future connections.

11. CLOSED
The socket is not being used. This is the state when a socket is initially created or after it has been closed and is no longer in use.


TCP Three-Way Handshake Overview
Client sends SYN (SYN-SENT state)
Server responds with SYN-ACK (SYN-RECEIVED state)
Client sends ACK (ESTABLISHED state)
This handshake ensures that both the client and server are ready to communicate and have synchronized sequence numbers.

Closing a TCP Connection (Four-Way Teardown)
Client sends FIN (FIN-WAIT-1 state)
Server responds with ACK (FIN-WAIT-2 state on client side)
Server sends FIN (CLOSE-WAIT state on client side)
Client responds with ACK (TIME-WAIT state before fully closing)
Practical Use
Understanding these states is crucial for network troubleshooting, optimizing server performance, and improving security. For example:

CLOSE-WAIT can indicate that the server application is not properly closing connections.
A high number of TIME-WAIT sockets may suggest excessive connection churn, which can be optimized by reusing existing connections.
